# Coin-brewery

Introduction

This project was designed with the main purpouse of attending to Coin brewery`s necessities,
such as control the leaven settings and care data to manage the laboratory routine. The clie
nt asked for a responsive and simple interface, which could be able to show all the routine 
data and change it easly in the middle of the operational tasks inside the lab.

Architecture

 The project was very efficient on practicing the programming skills, due to writing a seman
 tic,organized and readable code. Created by two developers, it was designed with Vanilla 
 javascript, CSS and HTML. We tried at our best to make the usabillity fluid and a clean
 mobile interface.
 
 About some design options
 
 I thought as a solution to the adaptability and mobile responsiveness to make a sidebar at 
 the leaven table, to make it easier to controll and view.
